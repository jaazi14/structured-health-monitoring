üöë Health Monitoring System

This project demonstrates a health monitoring system that collects, analyzes, and visualizes health data to help users track and improve their well-being. It integrates wearable sensors, real-time data processing, and health analysis algorithms to provide insights into key health metrics such as heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature.

üîë Key Features

Real-time Health Tracking: Continuously monitors key health parameters such as heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature.

Data Visualization: Graphs and charts to visualize health trends over time.

Health Alerts: Sends notifications for abnormal readings like high blood pressure or irregular heart rate.

User Profiles: Stores personal health data and tracks progress over time.

Health Reports: Generates detailed health reports based on collected data for sharing with healthcare providers.

Wearable Device Integration: Syncs with wearables like fitness trackers or smartwatches for real-time data collection.

üß† Technologies Used

Artificial Intelligence (AI): Used for analyzing health data trends and providing predictions.

Machine Learning (ML): For predictive health modeling and anomaly detection.

Sensor Fusion: Combines data from different sensors (e.g., heart rate sensors, temperature sensors) for more accurate health assessments.

Data Analytics: For processing health data and generating insights.

Cloud Computing: For storing and analyzing health data on the cloud.

Mobile Integration: Allows real-time health monitoring via a mobile app.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

Data Collection:
Health data is collected from wearable devices (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure, temperature sensors) and synced with the system in real-time.

Data Processing:
Data is processed using Python-based tools like Pandas and TensorFlow to analyze trends and detect abnormalities in health metrics.

Health Monitoring:
The system tracks user health parameters, updates in real-time, and provides insights into how these metrics change over time.

Health Alerts:
If any abnormal data is detected (e.g., high blood pressure or irregular heart rate), an alert is sent to the user via a notification system (e.g., Firebase).

Data Visualization:
The frontend displays graphs and charts using Plotly or Matplotlib, allowing users to track and monitor their health data visually.

Health Reports:
The system generates health reports based on the collected data that users can download or share with healthcare providers.

Mobile App Integration:
Syncs health data with a mobile app (built using React Native) for users to access and monitor their health data anytime, anywhere
